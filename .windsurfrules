# Zippify - Windsurf Rules

## Coding Permissions
- Cascade MUST NOT write or modify code without explicit approval.
- All changes require explicit user authorization.

## Modular Structure
- Components must be independent, clearly separated modules.
- Service integrations strictly separated:
  - `/services/auth/`
  - `/services/deepseek/`
  - `/services/eachlabs/`
  - `/services/google-image/`

## Clean Code Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle: Modules perform exactly one responsibility.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Clear, descriptive naming conventions.

## Style Rules
- Modular CSS: each component has its dedicated CSS file.
- Global styles minimized.
- Follow specified color and typography standards strictly.

## Security Implementation
- JWT-based authentication mandatory.
- Secure token refresh mechanism required.
- Unauthorized routes must redirect users to login immediately.

## Authentication Rules

- Users must complete their profile before creating listings.
- Prompt users explicitly if the profile is incomplete.

## Listings Creation Rules
- All required fields (title, description, images) must be validated before submission.
- Inform users clearly on missing fields.

## File Storage Rules
- Generated files available strictly for 24 hours.
- Files automatically deleted after exactly 24 hours.
- Notify users explicitly to download files promptly.

## Logging & Monitoring
- Log user authentication attempts, listing creations, API errors.
- Store logs in SQLite (`logs` table), regularly review logs.

## Limits & Restrictions (MVP)
- Users limited to a maximum of 20 listing generations per day.
- Inform users explicitly about daily limitations.

## Roles & Permissions
- "User": Standard usage (create and download listings).

## Error Handling
- Display clear, user-friendly error messages on UI for:
  - API errors
  - Missing or invalid user inputs.

## Performance
- MVP supports up to 50 concurrent users.
- Target response time: maximum 5 minutes per listing generation.
